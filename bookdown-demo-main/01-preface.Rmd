# Motivation {#intro}

First identified in Botswana and South Africa, this new iteration of the coronavirus Omicron has prompted concern among scientists and public health officials because of an unusually high number of mutations that have the potential to make the virus more transmissible and less susceptible to existing vaccines. Hence a big question for humanity is: when will it end or at least not affect peopleâ€™s lives? In our report, we aim to investigate how factors such as state and time can help us predict future outbreaks. The investigation potentially can help people decide to what places and at what time are they safe to travel if they have to.
